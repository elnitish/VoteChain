      <h1>About VoteChain</h1>
      <p>VoteChain is a blockchain-powered decentralized voting system designed to ensure fair, transparent, and
        tamper-proof elections. Our goal is to modernize the democratic process using cutting-edge technology that
        ensures every vote counts and every voter is secure.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why Decentralized Voting?</h2>
      <p>Traditional voting systems suffer from centralized control, lack of transparency, and potential fraud. A
        decentralized system eliminates single points of failure by distributing control across a network, making it
        resistant to tampering, manipulation, and censorship.</p>

      <h2>How Blockchain Secures Voting</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Once recorded, votes cannot be altered or deleted.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Every transaction is verifiable on a public ledger.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Voter identities are encrypted and anonymized to prevent coercion.</li>
        <li><strong>Trustless environment:</strong> Voters don’t need to trust a central authority — the system runs
          autonomously on smart contracts.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Why Voting Matters</h2>
      <p>Voting is the foundation of democracy. It empowers citizens to choose their leaders and influence decisions
        that shape their future. Ensuring the security and fairness of voting is essential to building public trust in
        governance.</p>

        verifiable — no matter where or who you are.</p>
